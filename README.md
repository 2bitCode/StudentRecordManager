# StudentRecordManager

#### Abstract
The mini-project "Student Database Management System” aimed to provide a computerized
interface to standardize and handle the daily activities of an institution. The key objective of
this system is to help the institutional staffs to overcome day to day documentation problems.
As an administration consists of a large number of students’ information, to store and locate
the required data can be quite tedious and time-consuming while keeping records of every
students and members is rather difficult. This project plans to overcome these everyday
problems with database management system for keeping the record of every details of the
students. The app is a demonstration of how a programming language and an Object-Oriented
Programming can be used to help solve common problems and reduce human efforts. The
fact that the project is a console app suggests that it is designed to be operated via a text-only
computer interface and takes input and displays output at a command line console storing the
entire data in a file. Overall, this project intends to lend a hand to the administration of a
institution to maintain the data in the best way possible reducing human efforts and manual
paperwork.

#### Introduction
This project was prepared by the students of the IOE, Pulchowk Campus 076BEI group including other three members @ tribhuwanbhatta as it is
necessary to develop a system that can keep track of their student’s enrolment
details. With the above aim, they should be able to have access to the information
mentioned in real-time. This will help the management to take decisions and also
will make the record and staff work more organized. C++ programming language
was used to complete the project. The primary focus lies on implementation of
maximum knowledge and ideas gained throughout learning Object Oriented
Programming in the project. Taking into consideration the difficulties and boredom
in manual student database management, this system hopes to facilitate systematized
management. The project was simple yet efficient.
